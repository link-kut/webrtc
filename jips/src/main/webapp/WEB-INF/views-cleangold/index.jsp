Indexing in the ESCI will improve the visibility of the JIPS and provide a mark of quality. This achievement is good for all authors of the JIPS.

			<h2 class="page-title text-right"><strong>PUBLICATION ETHICS</strong></h2>
			<p class="normal text-justify">
				With regard to ethical standards, the JIPS takes plagiarism very seriously and thoroughly checks all articles.
				The JIPS defines research ethics as securing objectivity and accuracy in the execution of research and the conclusion of results without any unintentional errors resulting from negligence or incorrect knowledge, etc.
				and without any intentional misconduct such as falsification, plagiarism, etc. When an author submits a paper to the JIPS online submission and peer-review system,
				he/she should also upload the separate file "author check list" which contains a statement that all his/her research has been performed in accordance with ethical standards.
				<br/><br/>Among the JIPS editorial board members, there are four associate manuscript editors who support the JIPS by dealing with any ethical problems associated with the publication process
				and give advice on how to handle cases of suspected research and publication misconduct. When the JIPS managing editor looks over submitted papers and checks that they are suitable for further processing,
				the managing editor also routes them to the CrossCheck service provided by iTenticate. Based on the results provided by the CrossCheck service, the JIPS associate manuscript editors inform the JIPS editor-in-chief of any plagiarism that is detected in a paper.
				Then, the JIPS editor-in-chief communicates such detection to the author(s) while rejecting the paper.
