        <td style=" text-align:justify"><span>The JIPS is a peer-reviewed quarterly journal that publishes high-quality papers after subjecting them to a rigorous review process. It publishes diverse papers, including theoretical research contributions presenting new techniques, concepts or analyses; experience reports; experiments involving the implementation and application of new theories; and tutorials on state-of-the-art technologies related to information processing systems. In addition, the journal’s editorial board selects featured articles with outstanding contributions and results, and introduces them on the journal’s homepage. The subjects covered by this journal include, but are not limited to, topics related to a) computer systems and theory; b) multimedia systems and graphics; c) communication systems and security; and d) software systems and applications. In order to disseminate the latest technological advances as quickly as possible, the decision to accept submitted papers is finally determined within six months at the most. To be accepted, however, a paper must be judged to be truly outstanding in its field and to be of interest to a wide audience.
		<br/><br/>The JIPS has four separate divisions, each having Associate Editors and a group of Editorial Board members, as follows. The journal actively recruits outstanding papers from each division.</span><br/><br/></td>
