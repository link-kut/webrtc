        <td style=" text-align:justify"><span>The JIPS operates a web-based online paper submission and peer-review system which allows authors to submit their papers over the Internet and check the status of the submitted papers simply by logging into the system. It provides online peer-review services, tracks papers through the review process, and helps to minimize the amount of time taken from submission to final disposition.<br/><br/>
	When a paper is newly submitted to the online system, the JIPS managing editor looks over the paper and checks whether it is suitable for further processing (usually by checking the formatting requirements). If the paper passes the managing editor's check, the JIPS editor-in-chief appoints an associate editor to handle the paper's review process. The role of the associate editor is to manage the peer review process for papers submitted to the JIPS. The members of the JIPS editorial board believe that the quality - and therefore the value - of the journal is increased by selecting appropriate reviewers to identify quality papers, and by managing the peer review process efficiently. After gathering enough (at least three) review results from the selected reviewers, the JIPS associate editor makes a ‘recommendation’, rather than a ‘decision’, on whether or not the paper should be accepted for publication. It is the editor-in-chief who makes the decision.</span><br/><br/>
