            <h3>ABOUT THE SOCIETY</h3>
            <p class="text-justify" style="line-height: 1.6em !important;">
                Ever since information processing became one of the most important industries in the country, computing professionals have encountered a growing number of challenges.
                Along with scholars and colleagues in related fields, they have gathered together at a variety of forums and meetings over the last few decades to share their knowledge and experiences,
                and the outcomes of their research. These exchanges led to the founding of the <a href="http://www.kips.or.kr/eng/obj_01.asp">Korea Information Processing Society (KIPS)</a> on January 15, 1993. The KIPS was registered as an incorporated association under the Ministry of Science,
                ICT and Future Planning under the government of the Republic of Korea. The main purpose of the KIPS organization is to improve our society by achieving the highest capability possible in the domain of information technology.
                As such, it focuses on close collaboration with the nationâ€™s industry, academic, and research communities to foster technological innovation,
                to enhance its members' careers, and to promote the advanced information processing industry.
